    Implementation of serial breadth first search(BFS)

    Parameters
    ==========

    graph: Graph
        The graph on which BFS is to be performed.
    source_node: str
        The name of the source node from where the BFS is
        to be initiated.
    operation: function
        The function which is to be applied
        on every node when it is visited.
        The prototype which is to be followed is,
        `function_name(curr_node, next_node,
                       arg_1, arg_2, . . ., arg_n)`.

    Note
    ====

    You should pass all the arguments which you are going
    to use in the prototype of your `operation` after
    passing the operation function.
