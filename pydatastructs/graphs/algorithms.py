    """
    Implementation of serial breadth first search(BFS)
    algorithm.

    Parameters
    ==========

    graph: Graph
        The graph on which BFS is to be performed.
    source_node: str
        The name of the source node from where the BFS is
        to be initiated.
    operation: function
        The function which is to be applied
        on every node when it is visited.
        The prototype which is to be followed is,
        `function_name(curr_node, next_node,
                       arg_1, arg_2, . . ., arg_n)`.
        Here, the first two arguments denote, the
        current node and the node next to current node.
        The rest of the arguments are optional and you can
        provide your own stuff there.

    Note
    ====

    You should pass all the arguments which you are going
    to use in the prototype of your `operation` after
    passing the operation function.

    Examples
    ========
