Welcome to PyDataStructs's documentation!
=========================================

This project aims to be a Python package for various data 
structures in computer science. We are also working on the 
development of algorithms including their parallel implementations. 
To the best of our knowledge, a well-designed library/package which 
has covered most of the data structures and algorithms doesn't exist yet.

Once the software design becomes more stable after a few releases of 
this package in the near future, we also aim to provide APIs for the 
code in C++ and Java as well.

.. note::

   This project is under active development and contributions are welcome.
